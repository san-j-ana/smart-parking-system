Smart Parking System - Research project with implementation

This repository contains the research paper and implementation of a Smart Parking System developed as part of an academic project.

## Overview
The system simulates parking sensor nodes that communicate occupancy status to a sink node using UDP over IPv6.

## Architecture
- Sensor Nodes: Detect and send parking status
- Sink Node: Collects data and manages parking allocation

## Technologies
- Programming Language: C
- Software Concepts: Event-driven programming, UDP-based client–server communication
- Networking: IPv6, RPL routing
- OS / Platform: Contiki
- Simulation Environment: Cooja

## Note
This project was developed for academic and research purposes
